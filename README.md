# Microservices Node.js and React

A course that focuses on the hardest parts to microservices, gives clear explanations, and discusses the pros and cons of different design options.

## Description

Microservices are the number one solution for building and scaling out apps that are intended to grow.  Just one little issue: there are few resources online that delve into the most complex and nasty issues around them!  I built this course to fix that.  This course tackles every major issues around microservices head on. From challenges with data replication to confusing unordered event streams, every major challenge of building microservices is covered. 

Beyond focusing on the basics of microservices, this course is a perfect introduction to the world of full-stack development.  You will work all the way from the frontend, assembling a React app using Hooks, to the backend, including database design and deployment strategies.  Every step along the way is covered in tremendous detail, with ample diagrams to ensure every step is crystal clear.

Many other resources show only the easiest, simplest apps written with microservices.  This course does the opposite: we focus on the most challenging aspects of microservices, challenges that you will likely encounter every single day.  You will see these difficulties first hand, then solve them with easy-to-understand strategies.
